This Python-based project implements the A pathfinding algorithm* to navigate a robot through dynamic environments. By utilizing the Manhattan Distance heuristic, the system efficiently identifies the shortest route while dodging randomized obstacles.

Tools: Python, NumPy, Matplotlib.

Features: Automated maze generation and path visualization.
